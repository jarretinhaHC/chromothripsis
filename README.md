Chromothripsis
==============

Simple collection of scripts to analyze data generated by the Cytogenomics Lab
(LIM36/HCFMUSP). At the moment, it covers some bead arrays from Illumina, aCGH
from Agilent and some RNA-Seq data from a Illumina HiSeq. The code is still on
its infancy and I'm not very proficient in R. So, things will look a bit rude
for some time. 

If you find this code useful, don't be shy! Use it! Comments are, of course,
appreciated. 

Licenses will be very liberal, so don't worry about it.
