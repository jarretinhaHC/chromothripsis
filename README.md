Chromothripsis
==============

Simple collection of scripts to analyze data generated by the Cytogenomics Lab
(LIM03/HCFMUSP). At the moment, it covers some bead arrays from Illumina, aCGH
from Agilent and some RNA-Seq data from a Illumina HiSeq. The code is still on
its infancy and I'm not very proficient in R. So, things will look a bit rude
for some time. 

If you find this code useful, don't be shy! Use it! Comments are, of course,
appreciated. 

Licenses will be very liberal, so don't worry about it.

Pipelines
=========

HD_CGH_Microarray_ISCA_v2_4x180k
--------------------------------

Covers Agilent SurePrint aCGH arrays. It's intended to:
 - Read
 - Background removal (median)
 - Standardization by trimmed means, outliers removed based on quantiles
 - Genomic wave correction using a quadratic polynomial model
 - Genomic artifacts correction using cubic splines
 - Segmentation/copy state calling using CGHcall
 - Post-processing to get a sheet of regions, state and coverage
 
HumanCytoSNP12
--------------

Covers Illumina arrays using crlmm/ArrayTV/VanillaICE. Results are a sheet of
regions, state and coverage.
